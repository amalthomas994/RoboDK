# Animate Gripper

1. Create two programs called "Open\_Gripper" and "Close\_Gripper".
2. Create a new simulation event for the close gripper program. Select the "Show Object/Tool" action and select the Closed gripper. Create another event in the same program and select the "Hide Object/Tool" action and select the open gripper.
3. Repeat the procedure for the open gripper program but show the open gripper and then hide the closed gripper.
4. Call the "Open\_Gripper" program in the Drop\_Bottle program and call the "Close\_Gripper" program in the Pick\_Bottle program.
5. Add "Open\_Gripper" program in the Init program as well (to the end).
6. When you run the main program, you should see the gripper opening and closing when working with the bottles.
