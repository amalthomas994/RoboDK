# Lab 7: Final Project

In Lab 7 you will create a RoboDK program which performs a variety of complex tasks based on everything you have learned from the previous labs.&#x20;

You may refer to the RoboDK Youtube channel to get inspiration on different stations and learn about advanced tools and features in RoboDK. However, you cannot create the same station as ones available in the tutorials.

You can import various 3D models and robots from RoboDK's online library.

The following videos show you various examples of possible stations you could build:
