# Robot Movements and Targets

Read the following guides or follow along with the YouTube tutorials to learn how to use the Robot Panel, learn what a TCP is, understand reference frames, and robot targets.

### Robot Panel and TCP

**Robot Panel:**

The Robot Panel is used to control the joints of the robot as well as move the end effector of the robot to a specific 3D coordinate and orientation.&#x20;

**Tool Center Point (TCP):**

The Tool Center Point (TCP), is the point used to move the robot to a Cartesian position. The TCP is defined as a transformation from the robot flange. Defining the TCP properly is important in any robot application.

### Robot Targets

Robot targets allow you to record specific robot positions so that the robot can be moved to that location.
